 - Support for en-dashes etc? (smartypants)
 - Check out all markdown extensions, see if there's anything good in there.
 - Fix image captions (currently don't show at all). (markdown-captions?)

Invocation
 - Watch all dependent files for changes (CSS files, images, mdf itself).
 - Always compile when mdf starts editor?
 - Refuse to overwrite foo.pdf if foo.md doesn't exist.
 - Write and quit in editor quits mdf without re-rendering document.

 - Use event-based file watching instead of polling. (inotify?)

Styles
 - Make style to repeat page head on every page.
 - Allow doing something like @import Font[Comic Sans]; or HeadingColor[orange];
 - Allow always including certain custom rules somehow (e.g.: always include Font Awesome).
 - Allow CSS: tags in document for custom styling? Or is <style> enough?
 - Allow supplying a foo.css along with foo.md?
 - Allow specifying paper size somehow. System default? Custom margins?
 - Bundle the relevant fonts with the built-in styles? (DejaVu, Ubuntu, Virgil, Gentium)
 - Improve checkboxes for FontVirgil

Logging
 - "foo.css" not found prints through editor, redirect somewhere.
 - Better capture all errors/warnings.
 - Support configuration of where to redirect errors; separate window, stdout, PDF, file, ???
